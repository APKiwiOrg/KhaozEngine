# Changelog

All notable changes to KhaozEngine. Versions are shared across the four packages.

## KhaozEngine.Ecs 1.5.0

- Deterministic iteration order: queries, `ForEach`, and serialization now walk archetypes in a
  guaranteed creation order (an explicit ordered list) rather than relying on `Dictionary` enumeration.
  Iteration is reproducible for an identical operation sequence, run-to-run and across processes
  (foundation for lockstep determinism). Swap-remove within an archetype is unchanged. Additive.

## KhaozEngine.Ecs 1.4.0

- Add named system groups: `AddSystem(system, group)`, `SetGroupOrder(...)`, `UpdateGroup(name, dt)`,
  and `SystemGroups`. `Update(dt)` runs all groups in order; `UpdateGroup` runs one (e.g. a
  fixed-timestep simulation group). Systems without a group use `"default"`, so existing usage is
  unchanged. Additive.

## KhaozEngine.Ecs 1.3.0

- Add a parent-child hierarchy: built-in `Parent` component, `World.SetParent` / `Detach` /
  `GetParent` / `Children`, and `DespawnTree` (cascade) vs plain `Despawn` (detaches children to
  root). Cycle-guarded. Hierarchies serialize (the children index rebuilds on load; `Parent` is
  auto-included by `WorldSerializer`). Transform propagation stays game-side. Additive.

## KhaozEngine.Ecs 1.2.0

- Add per-tick change detection: `World.AdvanceTick()` (call once per frame), `Added<T>()` /
  `Removed<T>()` (automatic from structural changes), `Changed<T>()` with explicit `MarkChanged<T>(e)`
  (since `ref` writes are invisible to the ECS). `Removed<T>` may include despawned entities. The load
  path does not generate events. Additive; no breaking change.

## KhaozEngine.Ecs 1.1.0

- Add `WorldSerializer`: JSON save/load of a `World` (entities + components + id-allocator state).
  Entities restore at their exact id/version so `Entity`-typed fields survive; tags and free-slot
  versions are preserved. Construct with your component types or `FromAssemblyOf<T>()`. Resources and
  systems are not serialized. Additive; no breaking change.

## KhaozEngine.Ecs 1.0.0

- Rewrite as a struct-based archetype ECS: versioned `Entity`, archetype/column storage, `ref`
  `Get<T>`, `With`/`Without` queries, `ForEach` arities 1-8, `EntityCommandBuffer`, typed `Resources`.
- Breaking vs 0.1.x: components are now `struct : IComponent`; `Get<T>` returns `ref T`; the
  `List<Entity> Query<T>()` overloads are replaced by `ForEach`. Versioned independently of the
  other KhaozEngine packages (which stay on 0.2.x).

## 0.2.1

- Fix: `PrimitiveRenderer.DrawProgressBar` rendered short bars as a solid line in the border
  color. A bar only a few pixels tall (e.g. a zoomed-out HP bar at 2px) left zero inner height
  after subtracting a 1px border on each side, so the fill never drew and the border covered the
  whole bar. The border thickness is now capped to keep at least a 1px fill area, dropping to 0 on
  bars too small to fit one. Adds headless geometry regression tests.

## 0.2.0

- `InputManager`: middle/right mouse-button edges (`IsMiddle/RightDown/JustPressed/JustReleased`).
- `InputManager.Touches` — active touches in virtual coordinates with stable ids (`TouchPoint.Id`).
- `InputManager.TryGetPinch(out Pinch)` — virtual midpoint, distance, per-frame delta, scale ratio.
- Optional gamepad/keyboard controller cursor via `cursorSpeed` ctor arg + `Update(raw, isActive, dt)`.
- All additive; 0.1.x consumers are unaffected until they bump.

## 0.1.3

- Fix: desktop clicks were suppressed whenever the game window was not at the screen
  origin. `InputManager`'s in-window check compared window-relative mouse coords against
  `WindowBounds` carrying the window's screen offset, so `Contains` rejected every click.
  The check now ignores `WindowBounds.Location` (uses Width/Height only), and
  `MonoGameRawInput` reports the client area at the origin. Adds headless regression tests.

## 0.1.2

- Add per-package README files (shown on the NuGet package pages).
- Add this changelog.

## 0.1.1

- XML documentation comments across the public API of `KhaozEngine.Input`, `.Screens`, and `.Ecs`.
- Enable `GenerateDocumentationFile` so docs ship in the packages for IntelliSense.
- No functional change from 0.1.0.

## 0.1.0

Initial release. Four packages extracted from Hardpoint/Nullwake/SpaceGame:

- **KhaozEngine.Input** — unified pointer (mouse+touch), `IsTapIn` press-origin invariant
  (click-through fix), region blocking, drag/scroll/pinch, keyboard + gamepad + menu-navigation,
  coordinate-transform seam (`Identity` / `Matrix` / `VirtualResolution`), all behind the testable
  `IRawInput` seam.
- **KhaozEngine.Screens** — screen stack with top-to-bottom routing, `ConsumeWhenVisible` /
  `ConsumeWhenHandled` policies, and transitions.
- **KhaozEngine.UI** — widget library, `PrimitiveRenderer`, `TextInputHandler`.
- **KhaozEngine.Ecs** — minimal `World` / `Entity` / `ISystem`.

30 headless tests. Hardpoint migrated onto it.
