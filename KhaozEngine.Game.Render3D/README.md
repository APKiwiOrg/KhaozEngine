# KhaozEngine.Game.Render3D (5.x)

The 3D integration for `KhaozEngine.Game`, split out so a 2D game pulls **no 3D renderer**. Three pieces:

- **`GameApp3D : GameApp`** - a `GameApp` that builds a `Render3DSurface` and drives the 3D pass in the
  `OnRenderWorld` seam (before the 2D HUD). Subclass it and override `OnDraw3D(Scene3D)`.
- **`IGameScene3D`** - a `GameScene` implements this (in addition to deriving `GameScene`) to submit a 3D world
  pass. Keeps 3D out of the base `GameScene`.
- **`SceneManager.Draw3D(scene)`** extension - draws the visible scenes that implement `IGameScene3D`, the same
  visible set as `Draw2D`.

```csharp
sealed class MatchScene : GameScene, IGameScene3D
{
    public void OnDraw3D(Scene3D scene) { /* submit the board + entities */ }
    public override void OnDraw2D(SpriteBatch batch) { /* HUD */ }
}

// in the frame loop, between scene.Begin() and the 2D pass:
scenes.Draw3D(scene);
```
