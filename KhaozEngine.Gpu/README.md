# KhaozEngine.Gpu

The GPU backend seam for the custom MonoGame-free stack: Veldrid contained behind an engine-owned layer.

What it owns today:

- **`GpuBackendKind`** - Metal / Vulkan / Direct3D11 / OpenGL.
- **`GpuBackendSelector`** - `Select()` reads the `KE_GRAPHICS_BACKEND` env override
  (`metal`/`vulkan`/`d3d11`/`gl`, case-insensitive) and otherwise probes the OS (macOS -> Metal,
  Windows -> Direct3D11, Linux -> Vulkan). `Select(string?, OSPlatformKind)` is the pure, headless-testable
  overload.
- **`GpuBackendSelection` / `GpuBackendSource`** (17.21.0) - the same choice, reported with its provenance.
  `Resolve()` and the pure `Resolve(string?, OSPlatformKind)` return `GpuBackendSelection(Backend, Source,
  RequestedOverride)`, where `Source` is `OsProbe`, `EnvironmentOverride`, or `UnrecognizedOverride`, and
  `RequestedOverride` is the RAW env value as read (untrimmed, original case) or null when none was present.
  `Select` is implemented on top of `Resolve`, so there is one decision path and the two cannot drift. A blank
  or whitespace-only value counts as no override at all. Only a non-blank unparseable value is
  `UnrecognizedOverride`, and it still falls back to the OS probe for the backend. This exists because a typo'd
  override is otherwise indistinguishable from the OS default: the run silently uses the default and reads as
  "the requested backend did not help" when it never ran.
- **Stored user preference** (17.23.0) - `Resolve(string?, OSPlatformKind, GpuBackendKind?)` (and the matching
  `Select` / `Resolve(GpuBackendKind?)`) put the game's saved graphics setting between the env override and the
  OS probe, so the precedence is `KE_GRAPHICS_BACKEND` > preference > probe. The preference arrives as DATA and
  is never read from disk here: this package references only Diagnostics + Primitives, and a settings dependency
  would invert that. A game passes it via `GameAppOptions.GraphicsBackendPreference`. `GpuBackendSource` gains
  an appended `UserPreference`; an unrecognized env value now falls through to the preference (it is not an
  override if it does not parse) while still carrying its raw text for the warning. With a null preference the
  behaviour is identical to before.
- **`IsBackendSupported` / `SupportedBackends()`** (17.23.0) - which backends this machine can actually run, as
  a FUNCTIONAL probe (Veldrid loads the library, creates an instance, enumerates devices, checks the required
  Vulkan surface extensions), cached for the process lifetime. **A settings UI must offer only what
  `SupportedBackends()` returns.** `OpenGL` always reports unsupported: there is no windowed GL device path.
  Necessary but NOT sufficient, so it is paired with the creation fallback below rather than trusted alone.
- **`AfterFallback(selection, fallbackBackend)`** (17.23.0) - the pure helper building the post-fallback report
  (backend becomes what ran, source becomes `FallbackAfterFailure`, `RequestedBackend` keeps what was asked
  for). Used by `GpuDeviceContext`, and by a consumer driving its own retry so both report identically.
- **`GpuThreadingCaps` / `GpuThreadingDiagnostics`** (17.22.0) - the graphics driver's multi-threading
  capabilities, on **Direct3D11 only**: `DriverCommandLists` and `DriverConcurrentCreates`, read straight off the
  live device with `ID3D11Device::CheckFeatureSupport` (`D3D11_FEATURE_THREADING`) and surfaced on
  `GpuDeviceContext.ThreadingCaps` (and `AppWindow.ThreadingCaps`). `GpuThreadingDiagnostics.Describe` renders the
  value, `ShouldWarn` says whether it is the bad case, and `EmulatedCommandListsWarning` is the wording the engine
  logs. All three are pure, so a game's debug overlay shows exactly what the log says.
  - **Why it exists.** A driver reporting `DriverCommandLists=FALSE` cannot build deferred-context command lists,
    so the D3D11 runtime emulates them by recording every call into a token stream and replaying it. That is a
    fixed cost on every recorded command, and Veldrid adds an extra `VSUnsetConstantBuffer` before each partial
    constant-buffer bind on exactly this flag. The two compound, and the result reads as "this machine is just
    slow". `GpuDeviceContext` logs an INFO line per created device and a WARN when the flag is false.
  - **Null means no answer**, and that covers three cases on purpose: not a Direct3D11 device, not Windows, or the
    query failed. None of them tells you anything about the driver, so none of them warns.
  - **A hard no-op off Windows and off D3D11.** The guard returns before touching the device and before naming any
    Vortice type, so that assembly never loads on macOS or Linux. Every failure path degrades to unknown instead
    of throwing: this is a diagnostic, and it must not be able to break device creation.
- **`GpuCapabilities`** - `ClipSpaceYInverted` / `DepthRangeZeroToOne` (so renderers derive clip-Y / depth
  handling from the active backend instead of a baked Metal assumption), plus diagnostics: `DeviceName` (the GPU
  adapter/driver), `SamplerAnisotropy`, `SamplerLodBias` (whether those sampler levers are supported),
  `MaxMsaaSampleCount` (the largest MSAA sample count the engine's MRT formats support, for building/clamping an AA
  menu), `SupportsShadowMaps` (whether the device can render + sample an R32_Float depth target, gating the
  `ShadowMode.ShadowMap` tier in Render3D), and `SupportsCompletionFences` (see **Completion fences** below).
  Read off the live device.
- **MSAA plumbing** - `GpuTextureDescription.SampleCount` (and `IGpuTexture.SampleCount`) make a multisampled render
  target; `GpuOutputDescription.SampleCount` / `WithSampleCount` carry the count so a pipeline matches its
  framebuffer (read a live multisampled framebuffer's count off `IGpuFramebuffer.Outputs`); and
  `IGpuCommandList.ResolveTexture(src, dst)` resolves a multisampled target into a single-sample texture. Default
  sample count 1 (single-sample) everywhere, so existing render paths are unchanged.
- **`GpuWindowHandle`** - a native window handle (kind + handle/display) the windowing layer hands over, so
  this package needs no reference to the windowing library.
- **`GpuDeviceContext`** - `CreateForWindow(in GpuWindowHandle, width, height, syncToVerticalBlank = true)` (device
  + swapchain for a Silk.NET/GLFW window; the vsync flag feeds both the device options and the swapchain, since
  9.23.0) and `CreateHeadless()` (offscreen device) on the selected backend. Two further `CreateForWindow`
  overloads since 17.23.0: a nullable `GpuBackendKind?` preference (resolved against the environment, WITH the
  fallback below) and a non-nullable `GpuBackendKind` (exactly that backend, no resolution and no fallback, the
  "retry as X" lever). **Creation falls back** to the OS-probe backend when the requested backend fails, rather
  than propagating, so a stored preference the machine cannot run cannot leave a player with a client that will
  not start. It WARNs, reports `GpuBackendSource.FallbackAfterFailure` with `Selection.RequestedBackend`, and
  **never clears the game's stored setting, which the game must do itself** (file IO is not this package's job).
  The retry reuses the same `GpuWindowHandle`, so no second window is created. Skipped entirely when the request
  already is the OS-probe default, which is every call with no override and no preference, so default macOS and
  Linux paths are unchanged, as is `CreateHeadless`. Exposes `Backend`, `Selection` (the
  full `GpuBackendSelection`, since 17.21.0), `ThreadingCaps` (the D3D11 driver threading caps, since 17.22.0),
  `Capabilities`, and the engine-owned `IGpuDevice`. The raw Veldrid device is private to the context (the
  transitional accessor that used to be here is gone, and `Capabilities` is read once so the context's copy and
  the device's cannot drift). Device creation and disposal are serialized process-wide behind a single static gate, on
  every backend: concurrent device creation races the Vulkan loader's dispatch setup (observed as
  `vkGetDeviceQueue` aborts on Mesa lavapipe under full test-suite parallelism), and creation/disposal are rare
  enough that the serialization costs nothing measurable. Callers see no API change, it only affects the
  interleaving of concurrent create/dispose calls across threads.
- **`IGpuDevice.SyncToVerticalBlank`** (settable, since 9.24.0) - flip vsync on a live windowed device: it
  reconfigures the main swapchain in place (no recreate, no leaked swapchain, size + depth preserved; on Metal it
  reaches `CAMetalLayer.displaySyncEnabled`). A no-op mirrored value on a headless device (Veldrid throws setting
  it with no main swapchain). `AppWindow.PresentMode` routes through it for runtime present-mode switching.
- **Completion fences** - `IGpuResourceFactory.CreateFence()` makes an unsignaled `IGpuFence`,
  `IGpuDevice.Submit(cl, fence)` signals it once the GPU has finished that submission, and `IGpuFence.Signaled`
  polls it without blocking (`Reset()` returns it for reuse). There is no blocking wait on the seam: the point of a
  fence here is to REPLACE a `WaitForIdle`, not to dress one up. A fence handed to a submission made after some
  earlier work signals only once the queue has drained through that work, which is what makes it a drop-in for the
  drain that guarded deferred GPU-resource destruction (Render3D's `RetiredResourcePool`).
  - **Gate on `GpuCapabilities.SupportsCompletionFences`, and expect two backends to say no.** Metal and Vulkan
    report true. Direct3D11 and OpenGL report FALSE even though Veldrid hands out a `Fence` on them, because on
    those backends it is a `ManualResetEvent` set on the CPU as the submit call returns, which is a submit receipt
    and says nothing about the GPU. `CreateFence()` throws there rather than return a fence that lies. A caller
    that cannot get one keeps whatever it did before.
- **Compute** (since 15.2.0) - `IGpuResourceFactory.CreateComputeShaderFromSpirv(computeGlsl)` compiles a GLSL 450
  compute source into an `IGpuComputeShader`, and `CreateComputePipeline(in GpuComputePipelineDescription)` builds an
  `IGpuComputePipeline` over it plus its resource layouts. Both handle types are separate from the graphics
  `IGpuShaderSet` / `IGpuPipeline`, so a compute pipeline bound for a draw is a compile error. `IGpuCommandList`
  gains `SetComputePipeline`, `SetComputeResourceSet` (plain and dynamic-offset), `Dispatch(x, y, z)`, and
  `CopyBuffer`. Storage resources: `GpuTextureUsage.Storage` for a read-write image (bound via
  `GpuResourceKind.TextureReadWrite`), and the existing `GpuBufferUsage.StructuredBufferReadOnly`/`ReadWrite` for
  storage buffers. Readback: `IGpuDevice.Map`/`Unmap` take a buffer as well as a texture, and
  `GpuReadback.ReadBuffer<T>` wraps the staging-copy-map-unmap sequence. Gate on `GpuCapabilities.SupportsCompute`;
  creating a compute shader or pipeline on a device without it throws.
  - **The workgroup size comes from the shader, not from you.** `IGpuComputeShader.ThreadGroupSizeX/Y/Z` is read
    out of the compiled SPIR-V module's `LocalSize` execution mode and is what the pipeline is built with, so there
    is no second copy of `layout(local_size_x = ...)` to drift (which would be invisible on Vulkan/D3D11 and
    silently wrong on Metal, the only backend that reads it). Do declare it: omitting the layout is legal GLSL and
    compiles in the 1x1x1 default, which dispatches one invocation per group rather than failing.
  - **Ordering rules, since there is no barrier call.** Compute writes a storage texture that a graphics pass then
    samples: record BOTH in the SAME command list and create the texture `Storage | Sampled`. A dispatch that reads
    what an earlier dispatch wrote: separate them with `End` + `Submit` + `WaitForIdle`. Full reasoning per backend
    is on `IGpuCommandList`, in `docs/USING-KHAOZENGINE.md`, and in `docs/design/GPU-COMPUTE-DESIGN-2026-07-26.md`.
  - **A compute-written texture that also needs a mip chain is TWO textures.** A storage-image binding must cover
    exactly one mip level, and resource sets bind whole textures rather than views, so the compute target stays
    single-mip and a second `Sampled | GenerateMipmaps` texture carries the chain.
    `IGpuCommandList.CopyTextureSubresource(src, srcMip, srcLayer, dst, dstMip, dstLayer, w, h)` seeds the second
    one's base level per array layer; `GenerateMipmaps` then fills the rest. Both go in the same list as the
    dispatch and cost no extra drain - the ordering rule above is about a dispatch reading a dispatch, and a
    transfer is where every backend synchronises anyway.
- **`ShaderValidation`** - `ValidatePair(vertexGlsl, fragmentGlsl, label?)` compiles a GLSL 450 vertex/fragment
  pair to SPIR-V and cross-compiles it to every backend target (HLSL, MSL, GLSL, ESSL) with NO `GraphicsDevice`,
  so a shader syntax error or a backend miscompile is caught in a fast GPU-free test loop instead of at first run
  on a real device of that backend. `ValidateCompute(computeGlsl, label?)` is the single-stage sibling for a
  compute shader. A compile failure throws `ShaderValidationException` naming the label and the failing
  stage/target. `ValidateCompute` ALSO rejects a source whose cross-compiled Metal entry point numbers its buffer
  arguments out of binding order (since 16.3.0): Metal has no binding decorations, so the cross-compiler assigns
  slots in first-reference order while the backend binds a resource set by counting the layout in binding order,
  and a helper function that reads binding 1 before anything reads binding 0 silently swaps the two on Metal with
  Vulkan and Direct3D11 perfectly correct. It catches a uniform/storage swap; two same-kind buffers swapping is
  not visible from the emitted Metal and still needs a readback test. The engine's own shader-source tests use this to validate every embedded production shader; games
  can validate their custom shaders the same way in their own fast test suites.

This is the ONLY package meant to reference Veldrid, and the containment is complete: the resource, command and
device surface is the engine-owned `IGpuDevice` / `IGpuResourceFactory` / `IGpuCommandList` interface set, the
backend implementation lives in `Internal/`, and no Veldrid type reaches the public API (asserted by reflection in
`GpuPublicApiTests` here and `VeldridLockdownTests` for the consumer packages). Swapping the backend is a new
`IGpuDevice` implementation, not a consumer-visible change.
