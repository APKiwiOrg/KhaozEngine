# KhaozEngine.MapDoc.Render3D

Optional native MapDoc rendering contracts. Reference this package explicitly. It is absent from every
umbrella and has exactly three direct engine edges, MapDoc, Render3D and Terrain.Render3D. It adds no
direct backend, editor, TileWorld or MapDoc.Physics dependency. Render3D already carries the three native
backends through Windowing. Terrain.Render3D carries the neutral Physics seam.

`MapRenderExtentValidator.Validate` streams verified geometry and checks every declared mesh tier and
typed light reach. Its `MapAssetExtentProofSet` retains bounds, source units and resource provenance only.
The encoded `MapAssetClosure` remains separate from decoded residency.

`MapPreparedInputLease.LoadSelected` loads selected mesh tiers and required native material dependencies
under one `GltfDecodeBudget`. Retain the input for each accepted or pending plan and dispose each lease.
Only the last lease releases decoded ownership. `MapRenderAssets` is independently disposable and owns
mesh tiers only. Its exposed meshes and images are detached copies. Do not dispose a lease's Assets
separately. Standalone `MapRenderMaterials.Load` results implement `IDisposable` and release their charge
when disposed. Prefer the combined input lease for scene preparation.

Native render materials use the embedded closed `map-render-material.schema.json` contract. Every member
is required, including nullable texture resource IDs. Textures name verified Material dependencies.
Numeric terrain IDs need explicit caller mappings. Prop material authority stays in the GLB.

The strict glTF and bounded image APIs are opt-in. They admit model, expanded geometry, image and copy
peaks before decoding and preserve typed capacity refusals. Bounded images currently support PNG and
JPEG. Compatibility glTF and flattened native loading keep their released lenient behavior.

`MapPreparedResource` carries copied immutable registration payloads. `MapDrawRecord` carries explicit
anchor-local transform and focus, channels and exactly one typed frame. `MapDrawRecorder` records these
without a device. Frozen water and foliage policies capture the caller's mutable objects. Foliage model
profiles and casting resolve into registration. Per-frame draw options exclude those stable values.

`IMapRenderDevice` measures upload demand before creation. An upload must claim its
`ISceneUploadReservation` before running any allocation factory. Retirement stays charged until the
renderer confirms release. Renderer publication, residency and the actual scene sink are later R8a work.
`ScenePreparedFoliage` declares the immutable 96-byte packed product. Its producer is not implemented here.
