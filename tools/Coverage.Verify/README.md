# Offline coverage verification

`Coverage.Verify` is a nonpackable library outside `KhaozEngine.slnx` and every engine umbrella.
Runtime code never references it. Public fixtures contain synthetic geometry only.

`CoverageExactConstructor` owns a copy of the inverse-bind palette and reusable per-pose scratch.
`TryConstruct` skins the source, applies frozen refinement, conforms and corrects the core, blends
transition weights, and gathers normals and tangents. It reuses Render3D's retained carry arithmetic
through the `Coverage.Verify` friend grant. Cold asset, support and refinement validation remain in
Render3D.

The three caller-owned output spans must have exact topology lengths and disjoint storage. On success,
geometry contains the transitioned candidate, `fullRecessions` contains full unweighted binary32
scalars by position group, and `representatives` contains refined vertex indices or -1 for inactive
groups. The constructor copies every output. Reusing its scratch cannot mutate a previous export.
A refusal leaves every caller output unchanged and returns `CoverageFailure` with its host and
applicable command and equipment context.

Construction alone supplies no geometry certificate. Pass the interpolated posed surface and the
candidate to `CoverageCertification.ValidateGeometry` with a `CoverageScratch` for the exact topology
instance. Certification checks protected bytes, welds, world recession budgets, caps, core domain,
folding, projected injectivity, affected host intersections, and commanded triangles against the
actual equipment solid. Full clearance and containment checks apply at full transition weight.
Ambiguous predicates refuse. A sampled certificate establishes only the supplied pose.

Geometry refusals use `CoverageFailureCode`, never message classification. A hierarchy walk storage
refusal throws `CoverageToolStateException` with `Reason`, `Required` and `Capacity`. Plain argument
checks retain BCL exception types.

Build and test the outside-solution projects explicitly from the repository root. GPU tests are not
required.

```sh
build-slot --label coverage-exact-tool -- dotnet test tools/Coverage.Verify.Tests/Coverage.Verify.Tests.csproj -c Release --filter FullyQualifiedName~Exact
```
